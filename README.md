# Windows-10-11-maintenance-script
A maintenance script for Windows 10 and 11 can help automate some common system maintenance tasks, such as deleting temporary files, updating drivers, checking for Windows updates, etc. Here's an example of a basic maintenance script you can use as a starting point

This script is a basic example. Be sure to customize it to your specific needs. You can add or remove steps depending on what you want to accomplish.

Make sure to run this script with administrator privileges so that it can make the necessary changes to the system. Additionally, keep in mind that running scripts can have unintended consequences, so make sure you have a recent backup of your important data before running it.

Remember that regular maintenance of the system is essential to keep it in good working order. You may also consider using third-party maintenance tools or security software to automate some of these tasks.

The best thing is to try it on a virtual machine before using it in production.

To run a maintenance script on a scheduled basis on Windows, you can use Task Scheduler. Here's how to configure a scheduled task to run your maintenance script using Task Scheduler:

Open Task Scheduler by searching for "Task Scheduler" in the Start menu or by running taskschd.msc in the Run dialog box (Win + R).

In Task Scheduler, in the left pane, select "Task Scheduler Library" to view existing tasks.

In the right pane, right-click "Task Scheduler Library" and select "Create Basic Task..."

Follow the wizard to create a new task. Give it an appropriate name and description.

In the "Triggers" tab, click "New..." to add a trigger that specifies when the task should be executed. You can configure how often and when your script runs.

In the "Actions" tab, click "New..." and select "Start a program" as the action. Then, in the "Program/script" section, specify the full path to your maintenance script.

In the "Conditions" and "Settings" tab, configure the options according to your preferences. For example, you can choose to start the task even if the computer is asleep, etc.

Click "OK" to save the task.

Once you configure the scheduled task, it will run automatically according to the trigger you specified. Make sure your maintenance script is saved in a location accessible by Task Scheduler, such as in the C:\Scripts folder. You can also specify the full script path in the task action to ensure it runs correctly.

Be sure to test your scheduled task thoroughly to ensure that it runs as expected and does not interfere with other activity on your system.
